              I am a DotNet full stack developer, working a product-based company
              called
              <a href="http://locgicsoft.co.in"> Logicsoft Pvt. Ltd.</a>
              with the title of senior DotNet developer. The company has been in the
              field of software products for the book trade for more than 30 years.
              Here we are developing business solutions for the book trade in multiple
              domains like e-commerce Web apps, Windows forms, Android mobile apps,
              etc. Here my main development focused on AspNetCore based web
              application development, and also i am participating in Winforms
              Development with the help of DotNet and C# programming knowledge. I
              started my career here on after 2017 with the designation of software
              engineer. Throughout this entire development journey with logicsoft, my
              knowledge has stepped up to the next levels, and I have learned how to
              enjoy coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2015, I began working for Mukils software. In the early stages of my
              career with Mukils Software, my full implementations focused on Windows Forms
              based applications with VB.Net. Then I have started to worked with Angular
              JS-based web applications, WCF and WPF. This is the place where I started
              to learn new things about programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              In simple words, I am the first graduate from a simple former family. I
              have completed my Masters graduation in Computer Science at H.H. Rajah's
              College, Pudukkottai, under Bharathidasan University, Trichy. In my
              college days, I worked as a trainer for computer applications such as
              Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Macromedia Flash, and C and C++. My
              programming ability has grown to the level of trying to write snake
              games with C and Visual Basic 6.0. In that time, I also tried to learn
              HTML, CSS, and Javascript to write web applications. In that attempt, I
              moved to a DotNet based web application development platform ASP.Net and
              windows forms applications to get result of FLAMES. That's where my
              career started to build in DotNet.

          <div class="col-12">
            <p>
              In my free time, I am trying to give something to the society which I have grown and learned. In
              Such activities one is helping today's students who are trying to achieve something in the
              IT industries specifically on Dotnet field or others, Yes I am training students who are interested in
              Learning programs / development, this is not only to get job opportunities, This is to enhance
              Themselves with learning, thinking, acting, behaving.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this tight time schedule, There is Less time to do such thing, But figuring out to help peoples is
              interesting.
              I am not trying to be a good teacher, I am trying to be a good guide. This kind of activities are required
              for
              my people Because there are lots of opportunities and a lot of peoples don't know about that. Because of
              that many friends of mine are working on different places which is not they have studied. This is
              happening
              Because
              the world teaching us to earn money not the way for it, the world teaching us to earn marks not the
              knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
              When i was a student, The world only tells me that the companies requires the people who has english
              communication
              in the finger tips, Who has knowledge in programing like a hacker comes in hollywood movies,
              who knows everything about programing, who knows A to Z on computers, who has 80 % - 90 % marks on mark
              sheets. In
              real world thats not true. The world not encouraged us to try what we wanted / interested thats what i am
              doing
              to my society. There is less amount of people coming out of the box which is the world drawing. In that I
              am
              helping
              someone to come out from the box.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, I have success stories on that. Those are interesting. Will Talk about it later
